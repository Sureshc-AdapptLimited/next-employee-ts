   ```

   Replace **'my-next-app'** with your desired project name.

   **You will be prompted with a series of questions. Here’s how to respond to each prompt:**

   **Would you like to use _'TypeScript'_ with this project?**

   Type **_'yes'_** if you want to use TypeScript.

   Type **_'no'_** if you prefer JavaScript.

   **Would you like to use _'ESLint'_ with this project?**

   Type **_'yes'_** if you want to include ESLint for linting your code.

   Type **_'no'_** if you prefer not to use ESLint.

   **Would you like to use _'Tailwind CSS'_ with this project?**

   Type **_'yes'_** if you want to include Tailwind CSS for styling.

   Type **_'no'_** if you prefer to use another CSS solution or none at all.

   **Would you like to use _'src/'_ directory with this project?**

   Type **_'yes'_** if you prefer to use the **_'src'_** directory for organizing your source code.

   Type **_'no'_** if you prefer the default structure without the **_'src'_** directory.

   **Would you like to use experimental _'app'_ directory with this project?**

   Type **_'yes'_** if you want to use the new experimental app directory feature in Next.js.

   Type **_'no'_** if you prefer the traditional **_'pages'_** directory.

3. Change to the project directory:

   cd my-next-app
   ```
